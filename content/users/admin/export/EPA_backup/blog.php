For those of you not familiar with military traditions, a foxhole is a pit that combat troops dig to give them shelter from enemy attacks. My training course occurred in northern Virginia, during the summer, when it was not only hot, but humid. So digging anything was not fun. Being young and lazy at the time, I proceeded to dig a foxhole that was barely big enough to hide me from the enemy.<br><div><br></div><div><a href="never-dig-a-one-person-foxhole.php"><u>Read More &gt;</u></a></div></div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i21"><div class="h2"><b>The 5th Note of Personality: The Harmony of Whole Type</b><br></div><div id="i23">Coach Paul's article on personality-type psychology was recently published in the Bulletin of Psychological Type, 32(3), 30-31. <a href="http://lifechangingcoaching.com/docs/The%205th%20Note%20of%20Personality%20%E2%80%93%20the%20Harmony%20of%20Whole%20Type.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to download a reprint of this article.</div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i25"><div class="h2"><b>The Skeleton Crew: Managing Work When Your Coworkers Are Out of the Office</b><br></div><div id="i27">Click on the following link to read Coach Paul's latest article appearing on Monster.com: <a href="http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/working-with-a-skeleton-crew/article.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a>.</div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i29"><div class="h2"><b>Good Leadership in Challenging Times</b><br></div><div id="i31">Click on the following link to read Coach Paul's latest article appearing in the American Management Association's Performance &amp; Profits Newsletter: <a href="http://www.amanet.org/training/articles/7388.aspx?pcode=XA9V&amp;CMP=NLC-PerformanceProfits2009&amp;wm_tag=email&amp;spMailingID=2775469&amp;spUserID=MTgwMTE4NTY0NzMS1&amp;spJobID=79498129&amp;spReportId=Nzk0OTgxMjkS1#about_author" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a>.</div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i33"><div class="h2"><b>A Life-Saving Tip for Home-Based Entrepreneurs</b><br></div><div id="i35">Click on the following link to read Coach Paul's latest article appearing in the Entrepreneur and Self-Employed (ESB) Journal: <a href="http://esbjournal.com/2009/08/a-life-saving-tip-for-home-based-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a>.</div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i37"><div class="h2"><b>Response to Time Magazine Article</b><br></div><div id="i39">Click on the following link to read Coach Paul's response to the recent Time magazine article on exercise and health: <a href="http://www.lifechangingcoaching.com/?p=279" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a>.</div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i41"><div class="h2"><b><a href="pens-and-faith.php">Pens and Faith</a></b><br></div><div id="i43">Does buying pens and other office supplies have anything to do with faith? I didn’t think so until last night. In these challenging economic times when dollars are scarce, it’s easy to give in to the fear that surrounds us. That fear often masks itself as “caution” and tempts us to hoard rather than spend. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big proponent of saving, but not hoarding. Saving is motivated by wisdom, hoarding by fear. Saving means putting a little away today to have something to spend tomorrow.<div><br></div><div><a href="pens-and-faith.php"><u>Read More &gt;</u></a></div></div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i45"><div class="h2"><b>A Roadmap for Effective Offender Programming in California</b><br></div><div id="i47">Click on the link to read about one of our first projects.
