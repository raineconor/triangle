After reading and considering nearly all of them, the one we like the most comes from Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, &amp; Lampel (1998). They define strategy in this way:</div><div id="i9">"The real world inevitably involves some thinking ahead as well as some adaptation en route."</div><div id="i10">What we love about this definition is that it incorporates the two most important elements of strategy–forecasting and responding– without overemphasizing either one.</div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i12"><div class="h2"><b>The Five P's for Strategy</b></div><div id="i14">Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, &amp; Lampel (1998) also provide a helpful framework for organizing the different ways that strategy can be viewed. They call them the Five P's.</div><div id="i15"><b>1. Strategy is a PLAN. </b>Strategy provides a roadmap or guidelines for an organization to move forward into its future.</div><div id="i16"><b>2. Strategy is a PATTERN. </b>Strategy is framework for achieving consistency over time and across departments and locations.</div><div id="i17"><b>3. Strategy is a POSITION. </b>Strategy is placing specific products in specific markets for specific purposes.</div><div id="i18"><b>4. Strategy is a PERSPECTIVE. </b>Strategy is an articulation of how an organization conducts its business.</div><div id="i19"><b>5. Strategy is a PLOY. </b>Strategy is action taken that is designed to outmanuever a competitor or an opponent.</div></div><div id="i20"><div style="font-style: italic;">“When I have won a victory I do not repeat my tactics but respond to circumstances in an infinite variety of ways.<i style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="background-color: inherit;">”</span></i></div><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="background-color: inherit;">- Sun Tzu</span></span></div></div><div id="i21"><div class="h2"><b>The Four Phases of Strategy</b></div><div id="i23">After studying what has been written and researched about strategy over the past 30 years or so, we have come to the conclusion that no matter which approach you use or from which school of thought you come, there are four phases of strategy.</div><div id="i24"><div id="i25"><b>Phase I: Strategy Formulation</b></div><div id="i26">During the Formulation phase, organizational leaders decide which approach(es) they are going to adopt and then set about on the challenging task of formulating a strategy for their organization. During this phase, organizational leaders should consider these things:</div><div id="i27"><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1; background-color: inherit;">Objectives</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height: 1; background-color: inherit;">Operational capabilities &amp; learning capacities</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1; background-color: inherit;">Environment</span></li></ul></div></div><div id="i28"><div id="i29"><b>Phase II: Strategy Selection</b></div><div id="i30">During the Selection phase, the organizational leader who has the decision-making authority selects the strategy that the organization will adopt. This is an important step in the process, one which a surprisingly large number of organizations never get past. For organizations to grow, someone has to decide on the overall direction in which the organization is to go.</div></div><div id="i31"><div id="i32"><b>Phase III: Strategy Implementation</b></div><div id="i33">During the Implementation phase, the strategy worksits way down from those who formulated the strategyto those who will be implementing the strategy. A bestpractice is to make sure that the most junior personin your organization has a clear idea of how his or herjob links in to the overall strategy for the organization.In addition to knowing what they are doing, everyoneneeds to know why they are doing it.</div></div><div id="i34"><div id="i35"><b>Phase IV: Strategy Management</b></div><div id="i36">During the Management phase, organizational leaders are actively paying attention to those issues that affect their organization’s strategy. Adding this phase helps keep strategy from ending up as just words on a page. Managing strategy ensures that strategy remains a dynamic process in the organization. During this phase, leaders should be doing these things:</div><div id="i37"><ul><li><span style="line-height: 16px;">Measuring progress toward objectives</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height: 16px;">Identifying emergent capabilities and opportunities</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height: 16px;">Revising strategy or organization as needed</span><br></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i39"><div class="h2"><b>Avoiding Failure</b></div><div id="i41">Charan and Colvin (1999) found that the number one reason that strategies fail is because leaders fail to execute them properly. Our Four Phases of Strategy gives leaders a way to avoid that problem.<br></div></div><div class="hr"></div><div id="i43"><div class="h2"><b>Conclusion</b></div><div id="i45">Remember, every team goes through the four development stages. How quickly they progress through them is often the difference between organizational success or failure. Let us help your organization develop high-performing teams that exceed your organizational goals.<div><br><div><br><div><div><i>References:</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Charan, R., &amp; Colvin, G.
